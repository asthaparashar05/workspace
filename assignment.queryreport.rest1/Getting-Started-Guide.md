# Getting Started

## Introduction

This project introduces a wrapper to [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) (Star Wars API) data source.

SWAPI is an open source data source giving access to Star Wars data as RESTful APIs.

SWAPI has 6 resources, People, Films, Starships, Species, Vehicles and Planet and a Root resource which has information about other resources.

It provides an easy interface to access these resources based on Ids or complete resource data by API URLs. The response data is in simple JSON format which you can play around with easily.

  
## Installation

No installation needed. There is a Javascript Library which you can use directly by placing in your project or extended it based on the requirement.

  
## How to use

The project provides a basic Javascript library <code>WebContent/lib/swapi-starwars.js</code> which can be directly used and extended.

It has functions to access all the APIs provided by SWAPI to access its resources.

Detailed description of each function is given below which will help you in understanding and using the library.
