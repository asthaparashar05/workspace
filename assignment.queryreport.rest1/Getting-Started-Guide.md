# Getting Started

## Introduction

This project introduces a wrapper to [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) (Star Wars API) data source.

SWAPI is an open source data source giving access to Star Wars data as RESTful APIs.

SWAPI has 6 resources, People, Films, Starships, Species, Vehicles and Planet and a Root resource which has information about other resources.

It provides an easy interface to access the complete resource data or resources based id or search fields by API URLs. The response data is in simple JSON format which you can easily play around with.

  
## Installation

No installation needed. There is a Javascript Library which you can use directly by placing it in your project or extending it based on the requirement.

  
## How to use

The project provides a basic Javascript library `WebContent/lib/swapi-starwars.js` which can be directly used and extended.

It has functions to access all the APIs provided by SWAPI to access its resources. You can modify the functions and also use frameworks to integrate with UI/backend as per your need.

The functions are described below in detail to help you understand and use the library.


* __getAllResources:__

This function internally calls a method which calls the root URL and returns the data of Root resource.
URL `https://swapi.co/api/`

Method Call:
```javascript
getAllResources
```

}
```

* __getAllForResource:__

This function takes resource name as argument and returns the whole data of that resource. You can further use this data as per your wish for comparing or sorting etc.
It internally calls the URL `https://swapi.co/api/{resource_name}/`
