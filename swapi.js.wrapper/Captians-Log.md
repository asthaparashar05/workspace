Went through [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) and the documentation to understand what it is and how it works.
Made the initial design for the wrapper for SWAPI and created README with its details.

Created a javascript library to access SWAPI resources and implemented an HTML page to show the data.
Started writing the Getting Started/Developer Guide to explain the features of the wrapper.
